						<p>
				Every year, Singaporeans look forward to 9 August to celebrate our independence and our common identity as Singaporeans. In a year like this, 9 August takes on an even greater significance, and serves as a rallying call for Singaporeans to unite and look to our future with hope and optimism.

					<div class="tab-content">						
						<p>
							In view of the current COVID-19 pandemic and with the health and safety of Singaporeans in mind, we will not be holding ticketed shows this year. Instead, many NDP elements will be brought into the heartlands and close to homes. Singaporeans can also watch the parade and show live on TV and internet platforms.

					<label class="tab-label" for="chck2020_4">Why was The Star Theatre chosen as the Show venue?</label>
					<div class="tab-content">						
						<p>We decided to move away from the Float as the revised NDP2020 show concept did not require mass performances in a large outdoor location. The NDP EXCO studied various options to assess their suitability to hold a Show that could fit the scale and concept that we wanted. The Star Theatre was chosen amongst other studio options as it was assessed to have the most suitable stage, technical equipment and supporting facilities. </p>

					<div class="tab-content">						
						<p>The NDP EXCO is working towards one show on 9 August. The preceding parades and shows will be internal rehearsals and will not have any spectators.

					<div class="tab-content">						
						<p>Safety is our priority and we will work with various stakeholders such as the Town Councils to disseminate advisories ahead of National Day, to remind Singaporeans not to congregate in a large group. We will also have ambassadors on the ground to remind Singaporeans. Personnel from the SAF and Home Team will also be deployed on the ground for crowd control. </p>
