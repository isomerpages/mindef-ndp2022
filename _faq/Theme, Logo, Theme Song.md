#### Q1-1. What is the Theme for NDP 2022?

Communities, families and friends coming together form the bedrock of our nation’s strength and resilience, and enable us to overcome challenges. “Majulah”, which means “onward”, encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our independence 57 years ago, and is a rallying call for Singaporeans to strive for a better future, and grow from strength to strength as we emerge from COVID-19.

#### Q1-2. What is the Logo for NDP 2022?
The logo portrays a Singapore that is stronger when love and compassion bring everyone together, and our national ideals continue to spur us on. The two figures holding hands and embracing a heart represent Singaporeans coming together to build a strong, inclusive, and caring society. The heart symbolises love for our nation and countrymen, and puts empathy and compassion at the centre of what we do. The two figures also outline the number “57”, reminding us of how far we have come since independence, the challenges we overcame, and the progress we made as an independent and sovereign nation. The five shooting stars show that when we come together, Singapore will move forward stronger as a nation, guided by our ideals of Democracy, Peace, Progress, Justice and Equality for all.
