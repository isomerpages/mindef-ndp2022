<i class="blue-text">‘Stronger Together, Majulah!’ – explanation is currently being proofread.</i>

The logo portrays a Singapore that is stronger when love and compassion bring everyone
together, and our national ideals continue to spur us on. The two figures holding hands and
embracing a heart represent Singaporeans coming together to build a strong, inclusive and
caring society. The heart symbolises love for our nation and countrymen, and puts empathy
and compassion at the centre of what we do. The two figures also outline the number “57”,
reminding us of how far we have come since independence, the challenges we overcame and
the progress made as an independent and sovereign nation. The five shooting stars show that
when we come together, Singapore will move forward ever stronger as a nation marked by our
ideals of Democracy, Peace, Progress, Justice and Equality for all.
