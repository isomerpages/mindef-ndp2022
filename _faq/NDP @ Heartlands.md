## 2. NDP @ Heartlands

#### Q2-1: What activities will there be at the heartlands? When will it be held?

Over the weekend of 6 and 7 August, there will be NDP 2022 heartland celebrations at five locations. At each location, Singaporeans and their families will be able to enjoy performances and activities, as well as view exhibitions and a static display of platforms by the Singapore Armed Forces and the Home Team. On 7 August, the Red Lions will conduct freefall jumps over two heartland sites. More details on the heartland celebrations will be shared subsequently. 

On 9 August, aerial elements will also make its way into the heartlands. The state flag carried by chinooks will soar around the island, while our F-16 fighter jets will execute a “Roar of Unity” flypast as they fly past homes across the nation. Fireworks will be set off in the heartlands, concurrent with that at The Float @ Marina Bay. More details on the flypasts and the heartland fireworks will be shared subsequently.
