You will be notified via the personal email provided during the application process. The notification email will be sent from the address: [ndp2022@hapz.com](#), and will inform you on the number of tickets that you have successfully balloted for.


#### Q5-5. I may have accidentally deleted my notification email. Can I check if I had successfully balloted for the event?

Successful applicants should take note that the official notification emails will only be sent from the following email address: “[ndp2022@hapz.com](#)”. Recipients of any notifications on NDP 2022 should beware of emails sent from other addresses as they could be scams or phishing attempts. You may notify the committee at [ndpeeps@defence.gov.sg](mailto:ndpeeps@defence.gov.sg) for suspected fraud activities. 

### <u>Ticket Collection</u>

#### Q5-7. Where is the ticket collection at? 
The ticket collection will be at **Central Atrium (Level 2), Marina Square** (6 Raffles Blvd, Marina Square, Singapore 039594).

#### Q5-8. What if I am unable to head down on the stipulated collection dates?
Successful applicants may forward their notification email to a trusted family member / friend to make the collection on their behalf. Please note that the QR code within the email is tagged to the personal details of the applicant, and any misuse of the tickets will be traced back to the original applicant. Do also be reminded that the QR code is only valid for a **one-time redemption**. Hence, successful ticket applicants are discouraged from sharing the notification mail to multiple recipients.
