#### Q5-13. What if I am unable to head down on the stipulated collection dates?
Successful applicants may forward their notification email to a trusted family member / friend to make the collection on their behalf. Please note that the QR code within the email is tagged to the personal details of the applicant, and any misuse of the tickets will be traced back to the original applicant.
