## Ticket Balloting

#### How many tickets should I ballot for to stand a higher chance of successfully balloting for the tickets?
There is no specific denomination that will guarantee a higher chance of winning. 

#### How are the successful ballot applicants selected?
The balloting process is carried out using an algorithm developed by GovTech, and is a process audited by KPMG to ensure fairness. 

#### Is balloting on a first-come-first-served basis?
No, balloting chances are not on a first-come-first-served basis. All applicants stand an equal chance of getting the tickets as long as they apply for the tickets before the application deadline.
