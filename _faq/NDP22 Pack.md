#### Why did NDP 2022 EXCO decide to collaborate with SG Enable?
Our core beliefs were to encapsulate the idea of “helping one another in tough times” – as we show appreciation to the compassion and kindness of our fellow Singaporeans, we also want to cultivate a stronger culture of care and inclusivity. 

The collaboration to feature the Artworks was intended to raise awareness amongst Singaporeans about the experiences of PWDs and Primary School Students during this trying period. It also provides these aspiring artists an opportunity to express their hopes and aspirations for Singapore and inspire Singaporeans to contribute to a greater cause. 

#### When did the collaboration start?
The Organising committee had an ongoing partnership with SG Enable since November last year. This collaboration remained through the revision of the NDP concept and format.

#### How many different bag designs will there be?
This year’s NDP Pack will showcase 22 different artworks done by aspiring Artists with Disabilities. These artworks are expressions of the artists’ aspirations and hope for Singapore as we emerge stronger after this trying period.

#### What is the theme of the artwork?
The theme of the artwork was “Stronger Together, Majullah”.  By engaging these artists, we hope to reinforce the values of embracing diversity, and the importance of communities and familities to give us strength to overcome challenges. We hoped that the artists can share their experiences during this trying period, and express their aspirations and hope for Singapore as we emerge stronger towards a better and stronger future.
