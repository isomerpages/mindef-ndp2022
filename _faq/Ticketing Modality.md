## Ticketing Modality

#### What was the consideration to go with physical tickets? Will it be seen to go against the move towards a smart-nation through digitalisation.
E-Tickets only started gaining traction locally during the COVID-19 pandemic and have yet to be used on such a large scale at The Float for the National Day Parade. To ensure a smooth admission process for show attendees, the traditional use of physical tickets was hence adopted for NDP 2022 to mitigate any potential on-site technical challenges. 

In addition, based on existing COVID-19 SMM, show attendees will be required to perform a Self-Administered Antigen Rapid Test (SA-ART) 24-hours before the event. From an operational perspective, the distribution model was designed to facilitate the seamless collection of both NDP 2022 tickets and ART kits for the show attendees. 

Pertaining to the smart-nation vision, certain processes of Ticketing this year, such as the application and notification have been digitalised. The committee will also be conducting trials and testing of E-Ticketing systems for future NDPs. 

#### Is NDP considered sustainable if tickets are still printed? 
The NDP tickets are printed with paper that have been endorsed by both the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (Asian Standard) (PEFC) and the Forest Stewardship Council. 

Both PEFC and FSC are non-profit, non-governmental global organisations dedicated to promoting sustainable forest management.
