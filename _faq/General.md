#### Q8-3. Are there any Temporary Restricted Areas for NDP-related aerial activities?
Yes, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will be establishing Temporary Restricted Areas (TRAs) over parts of Singapore on selected days in June, July, and August 2022, under the Air Navigation Order (ANO). The establishment of the TRAs is to ensure the safety of the public and the aircraft that will be flying at low levels as part of the aerial activities for National Day Parade 2022 (NDP 2022).

#### Q8-4. Where are the Temporary Restricted Areas and when will they be in effect?
Three TRAs will be established. These will encompass The Float @ Marina Bay and different parts of Singapore, including heartland locations, and will extend from ground level to 2,500 feet above mean sea level. The details of the location, dates and times can be found [here](/files/News%20Release%20-%20Establishment%20of%20Temporary%20Restricted%20Area%20for%20NDP-related%20Aerial%20Activities.pdf).

#### Q8-5. What kind of aerial activities are prohibited in the Temporary Restricted Areas?
During the periods of restriction, the conduct of all aerial activities including kite-flying, hoisting of captive balloons and flying of unmanned aircraft such as drones into and within the TRAs, is strictly prohibited, unless the required permits have been obtained from the CAAS.

#### Q8-6. Is it an offence if I conduct aerial activities in the Temporary Restricted Areas?
The conduct of aerial and unmanned aircraft activities within the TRA without the required permits from the CAAS is an offence under the ANO and the Air Navigation (101 â€“ Unmanned Aircraft Operations) Regulations 2019 (ANR-101) respectively. The penalty upon conviction for the offence under the ANO is a fine of up to S$20,000 for the first offence, and a fine of up to S$40,000 or imprisonment of up to 15 months, or both, for the second and subsequent offence.
