## Ticket Notification

#### When will the balloting results be announced?
Ballot results will be released through email notification from 27 June 2022 onwards. Only successful applicants will be notified. Applicants should also check through their junk email in case the notification is redirected there. 

#### I did not receive any notification email or may have accidentally deleted it. Can I check if I had successfully balloted for the event?
Only successful applicants will be notified. Please check through your junk email in case the notification was redirected there. 

In the event that an email was not opened by the applicant, the ticket provider will also send out reminder emails a week later.

#### Where is the ticket collection at? 
The ticket distribution will be at Marina Square, Level 2, Central Atrium. The nearest MRT stations are City Hall (NS25 / EW13), Promenade (CC4 / DT15) and Esplanade (CC3). 

You may collect the tickets between 10:30am – 8:30pm on any of the following dates:
08 – 10 July 2022
15 – 17 July 2022

#### What if I cannot make it for either weekend to collect the tickets?
You may forward your notification email to a trustable contact to make the collection on your behalf. Please note that the QR code within the email is tagged to your personal details, and any misuse of the tickets can be traced back to you. 

Do also be reminded that the QR code is only valid for a one-time redemption. Hence successful ticket applicants are advised not to share the notification mail to multiple recipients.
