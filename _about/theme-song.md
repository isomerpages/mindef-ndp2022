<p class="text-center"><b class="red-text">“Stronger Together”</b></p>

<p class="text-center"><b class="text-center">Verse 1A</b></p>

<p class="text-center">
    Relight Our Fire, we’ll find our way
And time heals all things, a little day by day
Everywhere that I go, see the people I know
All the faces young and old
Lift the spirits broken, hear the words unspoken
Still more stories yet untold
</p>

<p class="text-center"><b class="text-center">Verse 1B</b></p>

<p class="text-center">
    And I’m grateful still for the sun that shines
Spirit, Heart and Mind so clear
And I’m finding ways to be a better man
To be bigger than my fears
And with every breath I take, I believe
</p>

<p class="text-center"><b class="text-center">Chorus</b></p>

<p class="text-center">
    We are Fire through the night
We’re the light into the morning after  
Through the wire in this fight
From the flames we will soar forever
We will Rise, Rise, we will Rise
Stronger Together
</p>

<p class="text-center"><b class="text-center">
    Verse 2
</b></p>

<p class="text-center">
    Grateful, Faithful, Ignite a spark
May our deeds define us
And our words remind us
All for one and one for all
Now the road ahead may have just begun
We will leave no one behind
It’s in times like these we learn to live
</p>

<p class="text-center"><b class="text-center">Bridge</b></p>

<p class="text-center">
    Like a Phoenix from the flames we will Rise up x 3
Like a Phoenix from the flames
</p>
