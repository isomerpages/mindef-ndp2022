#### Music and Lyrics by Don Richmond<br>Performed by Taufik Batisah ft. The Island Voices<br>Arranged by Bani Hidir and Don Richmond<br>Mixed and Mastered by Don Richmond and Bani Hidir

#### *This is our song, a song for Singaporeans.*

Relight our fire<br> 
We’ll find our way<br> 
And time heals all things<br> 
A little day by day<br> 

Everywhere that I go<br> 
See the people I know<br> 
All the faces young and old<br> 

Lift the spirits broken<br>
Hear the words unspoken<br>
Still more stories yet untold<br>

And I’m grateful still for the sun that shines<br>
Spirit, heart and mind so clear<br>
And I’m finding ways doing all I can<br>
To be bigger than my fears<br>

And with every breath I take I believe<br>

**We are fire<br>
Through the night<br>
We’re the light into the morning after<br>**

**Through the wire <br>
In this fight<br>
And from the flames we will soar forever<br>**

**We will rise<br>
Rise<br>
We will rise stronger together<br>**

Grateful<br>
Faithful<br>
Ignite a spark<br>

May our deeds define us<br>
And our words remind us<br>
All for one and one for all<br>

Now the road ahead may have just begun<br>
We will leave no one behind<br>

It’s in times like these we learn to live<br>

**We are fire<br>
Through the night<br>
We’re the light into the morning after<br>**

**Through the wire <br>
In this fight<br>
And from the flames we will soar forever<br>**

**We will rise<br>
Rise<br>
We will rise stronger together<br>**

Like a phoenix from the flames<br>
We will rise up<br>
Like a phoenix from the flames<br>
We will rise up<br>
Like a phoenix from the flames<br>
We will rise up<br>
Like a phoenix from the flames<br>
We will rise…<br>

**We are fire<br>
Through the night<br>
We’re the light into the morning after<br>**

**Through the wire <br>
In this fight<br>
And from the flames we will soar forever<br>**

**We will rise<br>
Rise<br>
We will rise stronger together<br>**

**We’re stronger together**
