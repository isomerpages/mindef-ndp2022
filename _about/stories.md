                <p style="margin-top: 0px">In his youth, Whye Kee was involved in gang and drug activities and eventually spent a decade in prison. His father, who was battling the final stages of cancer, succumbed to the illness and passed away, however, because Whye Kee was still serving the last few months of his prison sentence, he was unable to be there for his father in his final moments or to send him off. Amidst his grief, Whye Kee discovered pottery and dedicated much time and energy to it as a form of therapy to overcome and distract himself from the loss of his father. To Whye Kee, pottery was a way to use something as simple, basic and calmly-looking as mud, and transform it into a functional work of art like a teapot or a teacup. In 2013, Whye Kee graduated from LASALLE College of the Arts with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree with Honours. Today, he runs Qi Pottery and is the co-founder of Beacon of Life (BoL), an organisation that works with ex-convicts, and Beacon of Life Academy (BoLA), an initiative that helps at-risk youths. Having gone through and experienced so much pain and darkness in his life, pottery gave Whye Kee the strength to move forward and harness the transformative power of art to help mould the lives of those who are struggling, like he was, into a person of beauty and purpose.

                <p style="margin-top: 0px">To support the nation when the pandemic hit, Singapore Airlines recognised the urgent and growing need to fill the manpower gap for the care of other patients as hospital nurses were re-directed from their original duties to care for patients infected with COVID-19. Singapore Airlines sent three hundred stewardesses and stewards for training to take on the role of care ambassadors to help the medical fraternity in caring for patients. The Singapore Airlines crew had undergone twenty days of training to acquire the relevant competencies. Under the supervision of full-time nursing staff, care ambassadors provided administrative support and attended to patients who required routine medical care via non-clinical roles. These included, but was not limited to, care-giving such as attending to call bells, helping patients to sit up in bed, accompanying patients to the washrooms, serving of meals and assisting during therapy sessions. Singapore Airlines strongly believes in giving back to the community.  Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi5S-91bw1s">here</a> to know more about the SIA Cabin Crew.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 0px">While the spectators see grace and synchroneity above the surface, the swimmers put in immense work under the surface. Strength, artistry, movement control, breath control and team work are required. The Singapore Artistic Swim Team train both in water as well as on land, with training sessions that include work on flexibility, strength, weight training and practicing routines. The team’s captain, Debbie Soh recounts how before each performance, she undoubtedly feels quite anxious, but her nervousness is soon dispelled as she draws strength from her team mates, women whom she has shared both joy and pain with. That no matter what the outcome, they are a team, and even in the midst of stress and pressure, together they can put a smile on their face and deliver a strong performance. With the support from friends, family and Singapore, The Singapore Artistic Swim Team made history by winning the nation’s first gold at the 2015 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, along with two more golds and a silver medal. Going strong in 2017, they won three golds, two silvers and two bronzes in Kuala Lumpur.
