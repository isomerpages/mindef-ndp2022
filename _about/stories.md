                <p style="margin-top: 0px">In his youth, Whye Kee was involved in gang and drug activities and spent a decade in prison. While Whye Kee was serving the last few months of his sentence, his father had passed away due to cancer. He regrets not being able to be there for his father in his final moments or to send him off. Amidst his grief, Whye Kee discovered pottery, which became a form of therapy in coping with the loss of his father. Pottery was meaningful to Whye Kee, in that something as simple as mud, can be transformed into a functional work of art like a teapot or a teacup. Today, he runs Qi Pottery and is the co-founder of Beacon of Life (BoL), an organisation that works with ex-convicts, and Beacon of Life Academy (BoLA), an initiative that helps at-risk youths. Having experienced so much pain and darkness in his life, pottery gave Whye Kee the strength to move forward and harness the transformative power of art to help give purpose to the lives of those who are struggling, like he once was. Whye Kee’s story reminds Singaporeans to be grateful for the opportunities and people in our lives and pay it forward by doing good for others. This coming together of communities, families, and friends, form the bedrock of our nation’s strength and resilience, and enable us to overcome challenges into the future.

                <p style="margin-top: 0px">While the spectators see grace and synchronicity above the surface, the swimmers put in immense work under the surface. Strength, artistry, movement control, breath control and teamwork are required. Before each performance, the team overcomes their anxiety by drawing strength from one another. Even under stress, they put a smile on their face and deliver a strong performance. With the support from friends, families and fellow Singaporeans, the Singapore Artistic Swim Team made history by winning the nation’s first gold at the 2015 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, and subsequently went on to win more medals. Passion and hard work, coupled with the love and support from the community and loved ones, has enabled our athletes to scale heights and fulfill their potential.

                <p style="margin-top: 0px">To support the nation when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, 350 SIA Group cabin crew had stepped forward to take on the role of care ambassadors (CAs). The CA programme allows SIA Group cabin crew who are temporarily grounded due to cancelled flights to be redeployed to public hospitals to augment the pressing manpower needs brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak. These Care Ambassadors carried out duties which include basic care giving procedures, nutritional care as well as patient service management for patients in low-risk wards. It is this spirit of giving back to the community that has enabled Singaporeans to stay strong in our fight against COVID-19. With everyone’s collective efforts, restrictions have been lifted and borders have re-opened. These Care Ambassadors have now returned to the skies.

                <p style="margin-top: 0px">One of the dance groups within the music video is independent dance crew for the Deaf, Redeafination. Redeafination aims to promote deaf awareness and bring the joy of dancing to the deaf community. The dancers are able to dance and keep in time with the music, through feeling floor vibrations or watching their fellow dancers. They also utilise a variety of methods, including sign language and visual cues, to effectively communicate and guide members of different learning profiles. They have been awarded numerous accolades and have performed at many events including the President’s Star Charity 2015, 8th ASEAN Para Games and the Norway Deaf Festival. They were also featured in NDP 2020’s “Everything I Am” music video. Their story reminds Singaporeans that dance is a form of expression that has no boundaries.
