 The theme  “Stronger Together, Majulah!” is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future. “Stronger Together” reminds Singaporeans that unity in our diversity is what makes us stronger. Communities, families and friends coming together form the bedrock of our nation’s strength and resilience, and enable us to overcome challenges. “Majulah”, which means “onward”, encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our independence 57 years ago, and is a rallying call for Singaporeans to strive for a better future, and grow from strength to strength as we emerge from COVID-19.

The logo portrays a Singapore that is stronger when love and compassion bring everyone 
together, and our national ideals continue to spur us on.

The two figures holding hands and embracing a heart represent Singaporeans coming together 
to build a strong, inclusive, and caring society. The heart symbolises love for our nation and 
countrymen, and puts empathy and compassion at the centre of what we do. The two figures 
also outline the number “57”, reminding us of how far we have come since independence, the 
challenges we overcame, and the progress we made as an independent and sovereign nation. 
The five shooting stars show that when we come together, Singapore will move forward stronger 
as a nation, guided by our ideals of Democracy, Peace, Progress, Justice and Equality for all.
