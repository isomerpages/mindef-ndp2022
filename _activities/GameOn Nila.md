Experience new and exciting trails this National Day with GameOn Nila!

GameOn Nila! is a digital game function in the ActiveSG mobile app that encourages members to stay active while exploring Singapore. It is suitable for all ages regardless of fitness level, and is great to use to bond with family and friends whilst outdoors.

NDP 2022 Adventure begins with the Singapore River Walk, where participants explore the humble beginnings of Singapore, tracing back its roots when it was a British Trading Centre in 1819. In this adventure, you can also experience the story of Singapore and its role in the region, as you explore the museums in the city centre. Finally, the adventure will take you to modern Singapore, and showcase how far we have progressed from our humble beginnings as a colony to a vibrant metropolitan city-state today.

Visit the various locations, clock your steps, hunt and scan the QR codes located on the trail markers to level up and gain Active Points to ballot and win exclusive prizes such as NDP Tickets and August Plushies!
