#### What is #DoingGood?
In celebration of National Day 2022, over 22 days from 16 Jul to 6 Aug, Singaporeans are encouraged to fulfil their pledges for causes. We have put together a range of volunteering opportunities through this 22 Days of Doing Good campaign. This is the chance for Singaporeans to come together, building on the spirit of care and compassion to make Singapore stronger.

#### How to Do Good?
You are welcome to join this initiative by participating in any of the volunteer opportunities organised by our partners by browsing in the link below, or by simply **#DoingGood** in your own ways!
