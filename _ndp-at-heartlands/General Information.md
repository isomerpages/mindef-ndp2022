### NDP @ Heartlands
This National Day, join us in celebrating Singaporeâ€™s 57th birthday at 12 locations in the Heartland. On 6 and 7 Aug at five carnival locations, Singaporeans can look forward to family activities, engaging exhibitions, musical and dance performances, and a static display of assets by the SAF and the Home Team. On 7 Aug, the Red Lions will perform free-fall jumps over two heartland sites. On 9 Aug, there will be Fighter Island Flypast and Fly-Our-Flag by the RSAF, and a dazzling display of fireworks at five locations in the evening.
